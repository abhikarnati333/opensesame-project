## 👋 About This Project

This is my creative project submission for the **OpenSesame Summer 2025 Engineering Internship**. Instead of a traditional application, I built an interactive web experience that answers the three core questions:

1. **How does OpenSesame fit into my career journey?**
2. **What strengths and perspectives do I bring?**
3. **What excites me about AI and the future of learning?**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Bold & Playful**: Colorful cards with black borders for a modern, eye-catching aesthetic
- **Interactive**: Hover effects, animations, and transitions that engage users
- **Personal**: Every section tells a story about who I am and what I bring to OpenSesame
- **Professional**: Clean code, responsive design, and attention to detail

## 💭 Why This Format?

I chose to build a web application because:

1. **It demonstrates my technical skills** - Shows I can build production-ready applications
2. **It's interactive** - More engaging than a PDF or slide deck
3. **It tells a story** - Each section flows naturally into the next
4. **It's authentic** - This is what I do best: building creative, user-centered experiences
